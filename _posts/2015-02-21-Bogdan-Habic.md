Having documentation when using a piece of code you didn't write is nice, but usually it's not that hard to mess something up/missuse it. Using some basic OOP principles we can enforce proper use of our code onto developers who are using it, and greatly reduce someones time when implementing something for the first time, while increasing the quality of the code.
