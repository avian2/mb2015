I will explain my process of learning HTML and CSS, preprocessors and all the turmoil that comes with it. Going through numerous tutorials, I will say a word or two about things you won't find in a tutorial. I learned about semantic HTML the hard way and midway through I found preprocessors such as Sass. At the end I will present Jekyll as free tool that everyone could use.
