War story about handling clients and building stuff, trying to provide some non development tips as well. Together, we’ll relive the journey from one insane client request to finished product that doesn't need much resources at all, just one cleverly configured server (ngnix + memcache). Along the way, you will see different approaches for handling caching requests with geolocation component, as well as learn from mistakes that we made.
