First, constraints based lay-outing is given, including a simple description of the Cassowary algorithm, some history, nothing too detailed.
Given that Apples AutoLayout uses the same algorithm, parallels are drawn and demonstrated, a small demo (screenshots and video) is shown.
GSS (GridStyleSheets) is introduced with a basic explanation of the various features, tying some into a workable demo (blog type of page).
Additional info on the possible future of the technology, where it's already being used, activity surrounding it, ..., and in the end a Q&A session.
