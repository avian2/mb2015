1. I'm a Frontend developer on this UK startup - truedash - http://goo.gl/oKzWPy. 
2. We're using AngularJs on our Frontend
3. We think AngularJs can be lots of fun and great framework but only once you know how to use it properly
4. I wanna share our experience with AngularJs - how we made a resource-eating monster, then did some research, got rid of the balast and finally got to a nice-looking and sleek superheroic web-app.  

P. S. the title of the talk is inspired by AngularJs description on their site - ""Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework"""
