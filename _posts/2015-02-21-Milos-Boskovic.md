Truedash is a new UK-based startup offering In-Memory Business Intelligence with Unlimited Data and Support. It's built on AngularJs.

Angular can be lots of fun and great framework but only once you know how to use it properly.

We'll be talking about some cool features Angular offers, as well as common pitfalls that a developer may run into when using them. We'll also cover how we in Truedash have dealt with these issues and how we fixed them.

P. S. the title of the talk is inspired by Angular description on their site - "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework"
