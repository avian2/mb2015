Everyone should be using Vagrant or some similar tool for local developer environment.
Still those containers/VMs need to be configured somehow and on top of that your configuration system should be able to manage your staging and production servers as well, you could be using Puppet, Chef, Salt, shell scripts to achieve this.
Recently a 3rd generation configuration management system has thown its hat into the ring, and that tools name is Ansible.

The talk will show how Ansible approaches configuration management, software deployment, remote execution and other tasks.
We will examine how easy it is to get up and running and manage single or multiple concurrent servers in parallel, and how to customize Ansible to your needs.
