In this talk we'll focus on the use of databases, specifically Crate in Docker containers, locally and in the cloud, the technical challenges and best practices learned. You'll learn about the reasons why Crate.IO is building "yet another NoSQL database" and why it's unique and important when running containerized applications. Also we shall speak about why the shared-nothing architecture is so important when deploying large clusters of containers.
