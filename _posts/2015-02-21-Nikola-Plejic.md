Clojure is a recent dialect of Lisp with JVM, CLR and JavaScript as its primary targets. By combining the popularity of its well-established target platforms with a focus on functional programming and immutability, it quickly rose to fame as a modern, usable, robust general-purpose programming language.

In this talk, we'll quickly introduce Clojure and its ecosystem (why?), go through a couple of use-cases including our first-hand experience with Clojure at Neutrino (when?), and see how it fits into existing systems and plays with others (how?).
